A pretty clear trend in human history is that as we become more technologically advanced, the speed of transfer of information increases. Ancestors alive only a few hundred years ago couldn’t move faster than the speed of a willing horse; and relative to the history of humanity even the willingness of the horse is a rather new development. The last 50 years alone have brought us impossibly interconnected road networks, supersonic flight, and quite literally light-speed, global, communication.

Compare sending an idea — a simple thought — from London to Tokyo. In the modern world it is something that is certain, guaranteed, and expected. Just grab your personal chunk of magically arranged rock and metal, tap it a few times; and what was in your head is now on the other side of the planet within seconds! A millennium ago it was an almost impossible task with a high chance of failure (see: death).

The cliché is that the world is getting smaller! It is far more accurate to say that the individual is growing larger and to fully appreciate the impact of technology on our individual consciousness—we have to consider it as an extension of ourselves. A stick is an extension of the leverage provided by the arm, and technology as a whole is an extension of our entire beings; albeit in a far more abstract form. As we create and surround ourselves with tech to increase the reach of our individual awareness and impact—each one of us grows. Your great-grandparents literally had a more limited perspective on the world. Their view was far more empirical and real; they could see, touch, smell, and — depending on the subject in hand — most likely taste the things they spoke about, the things that occupied the entirety of their attention. An existence quite different to spending the morning commute watching 4k videos of cats dancing for treats in Seoul.

The ever-increasingly talked about disconnect we love to point at when it comes to “modern life” is a direct result of this sensory overload — something that we as a species have already overcome multiple times in our evolutionary history through a mechanism that defines the way we experience reality itself;

Compression.

Although digital compression is fundamental to our ability to process and transfer the ever-increasing volume of information that technology exposes us to, the abstract mechanism of compression itself extends far beyond our current WiFi-riddled context; it has always been an essential component of the human experience, one that is ever-present in even the oldest sacred texts and images.

In Buddhist philosophy, the idea that thoughts arise from emotions, which in turn stem from sensations, is part of the teachings on dependent origination. The teachings of Pratītyasamutpāda elucidate the interconnected and interdependent nature of all things; an understanding that acknowledges the fundamental link between our sensory experiences, emotional responses, and the thoughts that emerge as a result.

Here’s a tldr; we experience sensations — such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile stimuli — through the apparatus of our senses. These sensations provide the raw data that our experience is made of, and as we encounter various sensory inputs, our brains are constantly processing and evaluating these experiences in relation to our personal histories, beliefs, and predispositions; namely our past. In doing so, we compress the almost infinite amount of information and attach labels, meaning, and significance to the sensations we perceive. This process gives rise to emotional responses; almost automatic reactions to familiar sets of sensory inputs compressed into an “ideal” image.
